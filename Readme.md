# Pig Game

The rules of the game are:

When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play
When the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The player who first scores 100 or more points wins.
